<!-- SETUP -->

# Training the Trainer
## A tale of two roles

???

Imagine a world where ,ALL Scientists, are ,competent, Bioinformaticians

... where they are as comfortable using an HPC as a wet lab

This is a tale of where I ,thought, I would be a teacher, yet ended up doing more learning.

---
# Problem

Evil HPC Usage

???

Scientists, unwittingly doing all sorts of evil to our HPC.

---
# Workshop #1

Intro to Unix

???

* Took Bernie's course, WOW

* Old notes (background reading)
* Question sheet
* Answer


<!-- CONFRONTATION -->
---
# Critical Reflection

Important

What/Why?

Many Sources

???

* Learners are #1
	* Very important to improve your course

* WHAT happened and WHY did it happen

Many forms
* Q the LEARNERS during session
* Survey afterwards
* Discuss co-FACILITATORS


---
# Results

Lost &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8596;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love it

Constructive Feedback

???

* Engagement/success very polarised
	* loved or hated it

3 common feedback

* Introduction presentation
* Lost between Questions, Notes and Answers sheets 
* More time

---
# Introductory Presentation



???

But how to do make this presentation effective?

---
# No Assumptions

From Zero

Terminology

Start Slowly

???

* Try to remember back before you knew topic
* Need to explain all new terminology
* Start slow and give an easy win

---
# 6x4 Rule

6 points

4 words

Maximum

???

MAX
* 6 points
* 4 words

It's best to discuss the items

Otherwise ADULT Learners think "I can READ myself"

Distracts learners from listening


---
# How we learn

.center[
<img width="75%" src="media/absorption.png" />
]

.ref[[1] William Glasser]

???

* READ 10% hence previous slide
* EXPERIENCE 80% great, workshops it is
* TEACH 95%, why you should pair up


---
# Primacy and Recency

.center[
<img width="90%" src="media/retention.png" />
]

???

30 to 60 seconds to grab someones attention

Leave audience with a strong message

Challenge to use knowledge gained

Test: what was the first thing I said today?


---
# 50/50 engagement

Why?

???

Not totally explained by lack of INTRO


---
# Learning styles

.leftcol[
1. Why
2. What
3. How
4. [What] If
]

.rightcol[
<img width="100%" src="media/4mat.png"/>
]

.ref[&star; McCarthy's 4MAT model]

???

2 continuums:

* How they like to perceive the information
* How they like to process it

4 types:

* WHY is it so?
* WHAT do I need to do?
* HOW does it work?
* WHAT IF I changed this?


* Often find that learners will start question with the name of their type

* **Spread around all** styles to gain maximum engagement.

# Workshop Changes

Think &#8594; Help &#8594; Answer

Re-word Questions

Smooth Learning Curve

.spacer[]

<div class="showable-container question showable-hidden" id="showable0">
	<div class="showable-inner">
		<div class="showable-header question" id="showabletitle0">
			<span class="link-like" id="showablelink0">What is the Answer to Life?</span>

				Ref: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_%28number%29">Number 42 (Wikipedia)</a>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

???

* Took Bernie's approach of Think > Help > Answer and "put it in their face" by including all 3 in one document
* Re-worded an handful of questions to cater for other learning styles
* Smoothed learning-curve particularly at the beginning

---
# Workshop #2 

Intro to Unix 2.0

???

What changed:

* 30min pres
* No homework (before)
* 2.5h (still)



<!-- RESOLUTION -->
---
# Success

Why?

???

Only **small changes** led to huge **improvement**


---
# The Accidental Game

Game-like learning

Accept failure

.ref[[1] www.instituteofplay.org/about/context/why-games-learning]

???

If learners perceive work to be a game they will accept failure more and be more persistent


---
# The Challenge

Scientist &#8652; Bioinformatician

???

I leave you with this challenge .., to turn every Scientist into a Competent Bioinformatician,, one exciting workshop at a time.
