<!-- SETUP -->

# Training the Trainer
## A tale of two roles

???

**Imagine** a world,, a world where ALL Life Scientists, are ,competent, Bioinformaticians

**comfortable**: ... where they are as comfortable using Unix as a wet lab

**Trainer > Learner > Trainer**: Over the last few months I had the opportunity to be, a Trainer, a Learner and back to Trainer

**Online Course**: I completed an online course on training and got to put much of it into practice.

**Do Training**: I encourage anyone running workshops and training to got out and do the same; it will improve your courses no end.

# Problem

Evil HPC Usage

???

**Villain**: At LTU, we had users doing all sorts of evil to out HPC.

**CORES**: Requesting 32 cores, using 1 OR worse requesting 1 using 16.

**Teach**: We needed to teach them how to do it properly.

...

Scientists, unwittingly doing all sorts of evil to our HPC.


---
# Workshop #1

Intro to Unix

???

**Unix first**: Before we could teach HPC, we needed to make sure their Unix skills are up to scratch.

**Bernie's workshop**: We took Bernie's latest Unix Workshop and ran with it.  

**WOW**: While reading it, I though WOW, this is awesome content, these students are going to love it.

**Pre-reading, Q/A**: As Bernie had done, we gave out older workshop material as pre-workshop reading and 
gave them the Q and A documents during the workshop.

...

* Took Bernie's course, WOW

* Old notes (background reading)
* Question sheet
* Answer


<!-- CONFRONTATION -->

# Results

Lost &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8596;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love it

Constructive Feedback

???

So how did it go? ... 

**Two Groups**: We found two distinct groups, the Loved it, OR were completely lost,  One even LOST IT

**Constructive**: We were lucky, the learners provided very constructive feedback.

3 common themes:

**Pres**: Introductory Presentation

**Lost**: Lost between the Questions, Notes and Answers

**Time**: wanted more time.


---
# Critical Reflection

Important

What/Why?

Many Sources

???

* Learners are #1
	* Very important to improve your course

...

**Important**: Critical Reflection is really important, as it aids continuious improvement.

**What**: you need to work out what ACTUALLY happened (which may be different to what they learners say) AND

**Why**: why did this happen which is not always imediately clear

**Many forms**:

* **Survey** afterwards
* **Question, Discuss and Observe** the learners during the session
* **Discussion** with co-Facilitators

In out case it, all the causes for failure weren't immediately obvious, but they did give us some useful incite.


---
# Introductory Presentation



???

The Learners had **asked** for a **Presentation**, but how might we do this **effectively**


---
# No Assumptions

From Zero

Terminology

Start Slowly

???

Cannot **afford** to make any **assumptions**

...

* Try to remember back before you knew topic
* Need to explain all new terminology
* Start slow and give an easy win

...

Also very obvious, we cannot afford to make any assumptions.

We must start from Zero, .. A blank slate

Introduce all Terminology, this can be thoughout the workshop but must be before it is used.

e.g. Command, Options, Flags: we may use them every day, but at one point we didn't know what they were.

Easy wins, baby steps

---
# 6x4 Rule

6 points

4 words

Maximum

???

MAX
* 6 points
* 4 words

It's best to discuss the items

Otherwise ADULT Learners think "I can READ myself"

Distracts learners from listening

...

With regards to slides, use the 6x4 rule

That is 6 points with 4 words maximum.

Keep it simple as waiting for the learners to read them in a distraction.

# How we learn

.center[
<img width="75%" src="media/absorption.png" />
]

.ref[[1] William Glasser]

???

LONG PAUSE!!!!

Some interesting research from Glasser about how much is Absorbed by Delivery Method

* READ 10% hence previous slide
* COMBINE: is best
* EXPERIENCE 80% great, workshops it is
* TEACH 95%, why you should pair up

# Primacy and Recency

.center[
<img width="90%" src="media/retention.png" />
]

???

**Primacy**: The first thing in your session is more memorable than the second etc.

**Recency**: The last thing in your session sticks with them more than the second last etc.

**Waste**: Consequently you want to put your most important messages at the start and end.  Don't waste it introducing yourself, or 
asking for questions.

**Test**: what was the first thing I said today?

...

30 to 60 seconds to grab someones attention

Leave audience with a strong message

Challenge to use knowledge gained




---
# 50/50 engagement

Why?

???

**Intro, not explain**: While an intro will help engage the learners I don't think it explained all the effect we saw.

**Why** might this be?

# Learning styles

.leftcol[
1. Why
2. What
3. How
4. [What] If
]

.rightcol[
<img width="100%" src="media/4mat.png"/>
]

.ref[&star; McCarthy's 4MAT model]

???

Everybodies learning style are different.

**4**: McCarthy suggests that there are 4 main learning styles.

**Perceive**: Which are categorised by how we **Perceive** the world (vertical axis)

**Process** this knowledge (horizontal).

4 types:

* WHY is it so? (MEANING)
* WHAT do I need to do? (THINKING)
* HOW does it work? (TEST THEORIES)
* WHAT IF I changed this? (TRIAL/ERROR)

**Spread around all**: Important to spread tasks over ALL learning styles OR you will have trouble engageing all learners.

**Continuum**: these are continuums so we can sit anywhere along each axis which roughly places us under 4 types

<!-- **Clue in Q's**: Often find that learners will start question with the name of their type -->

# Workshop Changes

Think &#8594; Help &#8594; Answer

Re-word Questions

Smooth Learning Curve

</div>

???

* Took Bernie's approach of Think > Help > Answer and "put it in their face" by including all 3 in one document
* Re-worded an handful of questions to cater for other learning styles
* Smoothed learning-curve particularly at the beginning

# Workshop #2 

Intro to Unix 2.0

???

We were lucky enough to have the opportunity to run the workshop a second time.

In version 2:

**Presentation**: included the 30 min intro presentation

**Homework**: removed the background reading (as most didn't do it anyway)

**Time**: left it at 2.5 hours (despite request for more time)

...

What changed:

* 30min pres
* No homework (before)
* 2.5h (still)



<!-- RESOLUTION -->
---
# Success

Why?

???

**Hit**: It was a huge hit.  

**Lost**: Nobody got Lost

**Finished**: most learners completed or nearly completed all the content.

**Not Fluke**: and to help show this isn't a fluke I develped a new HPC course along these
lines with similar success.

**WHY**, ... only **small changes** led to huge **improvement**


---
# The Accidental Game

Game-like learning

Accept failure

.ref[[1] www.instituteofplay.org/about/context/why-games-learning]

???

**Critical**: with a lot of discussion and critical reflection it dawned.

**Game**: we had turned it into a game.  Learners were trying their hardest to not use the **hints** (aka Cheats) 

**Failure**: If learners perceive work to be a game they will accept failure more and be more persistent


---
# The Challenge
.spacer[]

.center[
Life Scientist

&#8595; 

Bioinformatician
]

???

**Encourage training**: I encourage anyone about to do training to **First** be a learner.

**Challenge**: I leave you with this challenge .., to turn every Life-Scientist into a Competent Bioinformatician,, one exciting workshop at a time.
