# The story (NOTES)


"A personal story of discovery"

SETUP

	"Imagine a world, where all scientists are competent bioinformaticians"

	"... where they are as comfortable using an HPC as they are in the lab"

* Characters: Teacher and the STUDENT
* particularly, LEARNERS who were abusing our HPC.

	"We had this problem, were the users of our HPC were doing all sorts of evil things to it"
	
* Decided to run unix and hpc courses to correct their behaviour
